Hello world!

My name is Tobias Niedermaier. This is my experimental Github page. My plan is to share some of the R codes I wrote during my work as epidemiologist. For a list of my publications, please go to [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=niedermaier+tobias&sort=date). Maybe some of my codes are useful or interesting for the general public, and maybe others have some ideas how to program something more efficiently.

I also have a "normal" homepage which you can find at [niedermaier.rf.gd](https://niedermaier.rf.gd) and a contact form which you can find at [niedermaier.hstn.me](https://niedermaier.hstn.me)
