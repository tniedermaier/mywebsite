Hello world!

This is my experimental Github page. My plan is to share some of the R codes I wrote during my work as epidemiologist. Maybe some of my codes are useful or interesting for the general public, and maybe others have some ideas how to program something more efficiently.

I also have a "normal" homepage wghich you can find at [niedermaier.rf.gd](https://niedermaier.rf.gd) and a contact form which you can find at [niedermaier.hstn.me](https://niedermaier.hstn.me)
